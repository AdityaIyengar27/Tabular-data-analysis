# Analysis of a tabular data and building machine learning models
 
- Recently, I was tasked with analysing a tabular data with high class varience and imbalanced dataset. I had to visulize the data, then analyse and build a machine learning model for this. 
- As you can see, the problem with such data set is that there are many entries for one class. This makes a normal model learn patterns for this class but not for the other. Consequently, the classification of other classes also becomes difficult.
- In the python notebook file, I have formulated the pipeline and applied few methods to solve this problem. Later on, I have also built few models. 
- Please do let me know if there are any other methods which could be tried for such scenarios.
